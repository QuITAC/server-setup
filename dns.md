# How to change the Address records


Our registrar for the dev address (and later for the main address) is [namecheap.com]. we have pointed thier name servers to hetzners, to conviently manange all records and servers through hetzner.

For this you must enter [these servers](https://docs.hetzner.com/de/dns-console/dns/general/authoritative-name-servers/) on namecheap as `custom dns` and then use the hetzner dns console as per [https://docs.hetzner.com/de/dns-console/dns/general/getting-started-dns].
